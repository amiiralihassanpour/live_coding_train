# Live Coding â€” SRE and DevOps Journey

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to learn how to think and act like an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) and DevOps Engineer through practical, hands-on implementation.  
This repository is based on [AhmadRafiee/RahBia-Live-Coding](https://github.com/AhmadRafiee/RahBia-Live-Coding).
